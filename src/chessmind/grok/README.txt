Me Grok play chess!
===================


Introduction
------------

This is a Grok project.  Grok makes it easier to get started with a
Zope 3 web application.  In this case I am building a chess
application.  I thought it would be nice to be able to play this in a
web browser.  That at least saves me some trouble in coming up with a
user interface.


ChessMind
---------

ChessMind is a program that I am making for school.  The chess program
itself is in the chessmind directory.  It should not depend on Grok at
all.  You can go to that directory and run the tests by executing
./__init__.py.  If that does not return any text, all tests pass.  Me
Grok good programmer!
